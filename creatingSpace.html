                      They feeled overwhelmed about not having time for themselves and need a way to help
                      release stress and anxiety because they feel close to a burnout. </p>

                     <h2>Accessing the Competition</h2>
                     <p>Mindshift has a plethora of tools and features for almost every potential user when dealing with anxiety and a great learning section to
                       understand the science behind anxiety and fears. However, the app itself is quite buggy, they are lacking a community element and the
                       potential to keep users on their mental health path, with something like, gamification. Happify have the latest advancements in positive
                       pschology and neuroscience and they guide you every step of the way with a community element. A weakness of theirs is that certain features
                       aren’t accesible unless you pay for them and they are also missing links to counselling or physical excercise tips. Overall I need to:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>To include a community within the app to help users share experiences and make friendships</li>
                        <li>Make the app as accessible as possible with minimal to no features that need to be paid for</li>
                        <li>Consider a gamification element to allow users to keep them motivated on a positive mental health journey</li>
                      </ul>

                    <h2>Survey & Interviews</h2>
                    <p>From the survey summary I realised half the users have never looked for a stress and anxiety app,
                      let alone a mental health app. This lead me to rephrasing the question in interviews to
                      “How do you use websites or apps to help you with day to day anxiety and stress?” It seemed overall
                      that potential users would predominantly want a library of information at their disposal and wanting
                      to follow a community they can connect with.</p>
                    <p>A very interesting note was how uncertain users were about a gamification element within mental health.
                      30.8% is quite high for those not wanting any gamification and 53.8% for not being sure of the feature.
                      It will be interesting to find out further in interviews whether there could be a certain technique where
                      gamification could work for all users.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div>
                   <h2>Goals</h2>
                   <div>
                       <ol>
                         <li>In terms of discovering what main features users wanted, there was quite a
                           high number interested in a library of information. Potential users want a
                           feature that educates them about good processes to think about and
                           mechanisms to cope with things.</li>
                         <li>Including an insentive for users to continue looking after their mental health
                            instead directly using a gamification element. </li>
                         <li>Lockdown has made everyone more cautious that they need to better take care of
                           themselves and check in on how they are doing. A key point that repeated itself
                           was to find things that help you cope and give you escapism. Users also enjoyed
                           listening/watching vloggers and podcasts as a huge influencer of mood and inspiration. </li>
                         <li>It would be good to be checked in on and be given advice when you’re feeling low and can't
                           think for yourself what to do next or how you can move forward. Something like a silent companion,
                           when you need it is there for you.</li>
                       </ol>

                         <h2>Insights after affinity mapping</h2>
                         <div>
                             <ul>
                               <li>Users have different forms of behaviours and attitudes towards stress and anxiety and therefore
                                 different coping mechanisms. It would be good to have an additional feature along with education
                                 and community, that gives further help if users cannot find help with the first two features.</li>
                               <li>It’s important to acknowledge that users will also have different goals and needs BUT that they
                                 similarly will need mechanisms to help them cope, work through emotions and be reassured they are
                                 not alone. </li>
                               <li>To tackle the issues of not being easy to use, to make it more targeted, more interesting and to
                                 incorporate a gamification element that will not be too overwhelming there will need to be further
                                 research carried out asking about the why behind potential users needs.</li>
                               <li>Motivations and incentives that potential users had towards a mental health app. This would also
                                 need to have further research to understand the different techniques users use and how many technique
                                 crossovers there are in users.</li>

                          of not knowing what to do anymore (close to giving up). </p>
