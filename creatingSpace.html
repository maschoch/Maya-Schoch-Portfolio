                     <h2>Accessing the Competition</h2>
                     <p>Mindshift has a plethora of tools and features for almost every potential user when dealing with anxiety and a great learning section to
                       understand the science behind anxiety and fears. However, the app itself is quite buggy, they are lacking a community element and the
                       potential to keep users on their mental health path, with something like, gamification. Happify have the latest advancements in positive
                       pschology and neuroscience and they guide you every step of the way with a community element. A weakness of theirs is that certain features
                       aren’t accesible unless you pay for them and they are also missing links to counselling or physical excercise tips. Overall I need to:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>To include a community within the app to help users share experiences and make friendships</li>
                        <li>Make the app as accessible as possible with minimal to no features that need to be paid for</li>
                        <li>Consider a gamification element to allow users to keep them motivated on a positive mental health journey</li>
                      </ul>

                    <h2>Survey & Interviews</h2>
                    <p>From the survey summary I realised half the users have never looked for a stress and anxiety app,
                      let alone a mental health app. This lead me to rephrasing the question in interviews to
                      “How do you use websites or apps to help you with day to day anxiety and stress?” It seemed overall
                      that potential users would predominantly want a library of information at their disposal and wanting
                      to follow a community they can connect with.</p>
                    <p>A very interesting note was how uncertain users were about a gamification element within mental health.
                      30.8% is quite high for those not wanting any gamification and 53.8% for not being sure of the feature.
                      It will be interesting to find out further in interviews whether there could be a certain technique where
                      gamification could work for all users.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div>
                   <h2>Goals</h2>
                   <div>
                       <ol>
                         <li>In terms of discovering what main features users wanted, there was quite a
                           high number interested in a library of information. Potential users want a
                           feature that educates them about good processes to think about and
                           mechanisms to cope with things.</li>
                         <li>Including an insentive for users to continue looking after their mental health
                            instead directly using a gamification element. </li>
                         <li>Lockdown has made everyone more cautious that they need to better take care of
                           themselves and check in on how they are doing. A key point that repeated itself
                           was to find things that help you cope and give you escapism. Users also enjoyed
                           listening/watching vloggers and podcasts as a huge influencer of mood and inspiration. </li>
                         <li>It would be good to be checked in on and be given advice when you’re feeling low and can't
                           think for yourself what to do next or how you can move forward. Something like a silent companion,
                           when you need it is there for you.</li>
                       </ol>

                         <h2>Insights after affinity mapping</h2>
                         <div>
                             <ul>
                               <li>Users have different forms of behaviours and attitudes towards stress and anxiety and therefore
                                 different coping mechanisms. It would be good to have an additional feature along with education
                                 and community, that gives further help if users cannot find help with the first two features.</li>
                               <li>It’s important to acknowledge that users will also have different goals and needs BUT that they
                                 similarly will need mechanisms to help them cope, work through emotions and be reassured they are
                                 not alone. </li>
                               <li>To tackle the issues of not being easy to use, to make it more targeted, more interesting and to
                                 incorporate a gamification element that will not be too overwhelming there will need to be further
                                 research carried out asking about the why behind potential users needs.</li>
                               <li>Motivations and incentives that potential users had towards a mental health app. This would also
                                 need to have further research to understand the different techniques users use and how many technique
                                 crossovers there are in users.</li>

                          of not knowing what to do anymore (close to giving up). </p>

                               <li>Most tasks were easily carried out but getting to the journal page and to pose a question came up with the most problems</li>
                               <li>Participants were unsure about writing in a journal online</li>
                               <li>The majority of participants felt that choosing your mood on the journal page should be before the journal entry itself</li>
                               <li>A search feature for the app was highly requested</li>

                               <li>There were mixed messages about the Landing Page being too busy or possibly looking to corporate (something to research into further)</li>

                                 <li>It was always a great learning point to get a response from a participant you were not expecting.
                                   You can further explore and ask questions that weren’t on the script.</li>
                                 <li>I learned what makes ense to me doesn’t always make sense to others. An example of this was to
                                   swipe away a medication from the health feature before being able to continue on the page.</li>
                                 <li>I was suprised to learn how shocked participants were with the transition from the onboarding
                                   page to the hompeage. Users were requiring reassurance that they had successfully completed the task.</li>

                         <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
                         <p>2 of 6 participants found it difficult to find the navigation. This may be due to it being a B&W prototype and
                           that the prototype was being tested on a computer for some participants and not directly on their mobile.
                           As it was more due to the presentation of the prototype this makes the severity level low.</p>
                         <h4>Solution</h4>
                         <p>This will be resolved with the help of UI but will be tested in future to see if this issue comes about again.</p>

                         <p>All participants found it very difficult to confirm a medication being taken and it wasn’t clear that you
                           could swipe it away. This makes the severity level high and it wasn’t clear that you could swipe it away.</p>

                         <p>3 of 6 participants found it confusing that there was no screen between onboarding and the homepage
                           to complete their task and it took participants a little while to find their bearings. </p>

                         <p>I wanted the palette to reflect intrigue as well as relaxation. As this is a mental health website it was
                           important to attract the user but not to be overbearing, as I found out in the user testing when there is
                           too much happening on the page it creates anxiety and that’s something to avoid when you’re already dealing
                           with anxiety on a day to day basis. </p>

                         <p>The option to fill in the form fields was already possible by voice. But to give them one less click
                           the user is able to click only once to access the voice control immediately. As there is a different
                           design language for the forms, I have adapted them to fit those of the SIgn up and login page.</p>

                           the reading style of left to right. The different categories moved from being only links on the text to a whole
                           button link. </p>
                         <p>The navigation also had a few changes, one being changing the apple icon to a heart. But to make it slightly
                           different to the traditional like icon, I looked for an icon that also had more detail related to health inside it.
                           The navigation also changed with highlighting the selected menu icon in the blue/green.</p>

                         <p>The science behind became a more prominent page, showcasing the most recently added sections of the discover
                           feature. A welcome message was also added to make it more personal and individual. More focus was given to
                           the journal page as during user testing it was seen to more more a discovery or profile page.</p>

                           To describe this slider mechanism further, a small info screen will pop up for the user to help them navigate the slider.</p>

                         <p>Originally the landing page started as a replica of the discovery page but as it wasn’t as effective on giving a
                           full view of the app itself, changes were mdae to allow for introductory text to invite the user in. As well as a
                           more prominent CTA and second incentive text below. The images were also added to showcase users appreciating the app.</p>
